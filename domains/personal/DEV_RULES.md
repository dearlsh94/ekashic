# Personal Development Rules

## 🚀 Speed & Innovation
- **MVP First**: Focus on rapid prototyping and delivering working features. Don't let perfection hinder progress.
- **AI-Native Workflow**: Maximize productivity by leveraging AI for boilerplate generation, refactoring, and testing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Patterns
- **Modern Standards**: Actively adopt the latest stable features of frameworks and languages.
- **Strict Typing**: Maintain high type safety (TypeScript). Avoid `any` and use strict validation patterns.
- **Functional Paradigm**: Prefer immutability and pure functions to ensure predictable state and easy testing.

## 📝 Personal Knowledge Base
- **Exploratory Docs**: Maintain a `TODO.md` or `ROADMAP.md` to track the evolution of ideas and technical debt.
- **Learning Journal**: Document challenges faced during new tech adoption for future reference.
